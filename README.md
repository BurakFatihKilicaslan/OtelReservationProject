# Hotel Reservation Website

A hotel reservation and ordering website developed using MVC, Entity Framework, SQL Server, C#, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, and Identity. Customers can make reservations even without registering. They can select one of the available rooms and after completing the necessary steps, they can express their request by clicking the "Make Reservation" button. Once the reservation request is made by the customer, it is approved by the admin who manages the hotel website, and then the reservation is confirmed.

Customers can also subscribe to the hotel's newsletter and send messages. The admin user can log in to the system and perform necessary add, delete, and update operations. They can manage the reservations made by customers, update their own information, and manage the information of the hotel's staff.

The aim of this project is to allow users to easily make hotel reservations and enable easy management of the hotel's reservations by the admin user.
